# Todo List

A simple todo list app with React Native

## Features

1. New tasks are at the top
1. Tasks move to the bottom when marked as done
1. Completed tasks can be marked again as undone, moving them to the top
1. Completed tasks have a strikethrough and a lighter color
1. Dark theme (caveat: set in code for now with `isDark` in `styles/colors.tsx`, no toggle given to the user)
1. **Easter Egg:** Try adding a task of the form `anime: <search term>` to search for it on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
